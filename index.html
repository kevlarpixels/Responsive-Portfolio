                Hi, my name is Kevin Aguilar. I am curious about how the world works. Recently, I took a test to find a little bit about
                myself. I mean, I know who I am. I decided to take a test for fun. I am a person who is introverted, intuitive,
                thoughtful, and perceptive, INTP, according to the Myers-Briggs type indicator, a theory on how humans perceive
                the world. WOW. That was spot on and a little creepy. The Briggs might be up to something.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Anyway, when I am not randomly reading about economics, scientific theories or taking a psychological test. I am trying to
                figure out a problem at work, home, or society because I tend to spend time thinking of a possible solution,
                which makes life pretty interesting. Sidenote, there are many days I stare at my laptop and notepad breaking
                my head.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also love to travel. I believe it grounds me. Click on the site's logo to see some of my photos from around the world.
